## About Me
- (untenured) Associate Professor in Finance, Wuhan Uni.; AE, [*Financial Economics Letters*](https://www.anserpress.org/journal/fel).


## Research Interests

- Macroeconomics, Asset Pricing


## News
- **[Jul. 2025]** We are revising a RED R&R, co-authored with PhD student (WHU), on how consumption taxes influence ZLB duration.
- **[Jun. 2025]** Empirically, migration increases housing price dispersion and raises inequality. We explain this with a two-asset heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium model, where real estate acts as the key channel connecting migration and inequality.
- **[Feb. 2025]** In China, low inflation, and high real rates twist policy gears. We find that active fiscal and moderate monetary policies mitigate demand shock effects.
