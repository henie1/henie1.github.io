## Selected Works
- **Macroeconomic effects of monetary and fiscal policy in tractable DSGE models:**
<ol>
<li><b>The Promises (and Perils) of Control-Contingent Forward Guidance (JMP)</b>
  <br>
  with Jordan Roulleau-Pasdeloup
  <br>
  <br>Key insights: We develop a model with control-contingent forward guidance: the central bank explicitly anchors future policy announcements to short run inflation. We show analytically that control-contingent forward guidance can rid the model of sunspot liquidity traps. We also leverage this new framework to formally show that announced interest rates are only a means to an end: what truly matters is expected inflation.
