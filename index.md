## Selected Works
- **Macroeconomic effects of monetary and fiscal policy in tractable DSGE models:**
1. **[The Promises (and Perils) of Control-Contingent Forward Guidance (JMP)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.red.2022.07.002)** <br>
  with Jordan Roulleau-Pasdeloup <br>
  Key insights: We develop a model with control-contingent forward guidance: the central bank explicitly anchors future policy announcements to short run inflation. We show analytically that control-contingent forward guidance can rid the model of sunspot liquidity traps. We also leverage this new framework to formally show that announced interest rates are only a means to an end: what truly matters is expected inflation.<br>
